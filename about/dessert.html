               PISTACHIO ICE CREAM
            </h2>

            <p>
              Pistachio ice cream is the best desert because: 
                <br>
              First off before we even get a bite, the color is delicously polarizing. 
               <br>
              The gorgeous pastel verde mimics a field filled with majestic honey dew hydrangeas, green enough to make your mouth water.<br>
                Once you take a bite you'll never go back to the bland vanilla or the boring choclate flavor ever again.
                The crunchiness of the almonds complement the slick and savory flavor of the lime green cream.
                Be careful, once you go pistachio, you'll crave that salty savory taste forever.

                Best dessert 2:
               CHERRY PIE
            </h2>
            <img src="images/vegan-cherry-pie-sq1-1.jpg">
            <p>
                Cherry pie is absolutly delicous.
                <br>
               I love the look of a classic cherry pie, the red syrupy organs peaking through the sugar glazed catacombs, peering up at you.
                <br>
                Cherry pie has the best and most tangy, sweet, and absolutly delectable favor of any food other than pistachio ice cream.
                The way the cherry pops on your tounge with the correct bite is euphoric, GO AND TRY SOME CHERRY PIE.

                Brownies are nothing compared to Pistachio ice cream or Cherry pie, but lawd they are delicous!
                <br>
                First off brownies are the most versitle dish ever created.
                <br>
                You could eat brownies with ice cream, whipped cream, choclate chips, powdered sugar, choclate drizzle, caramel drizzle, sprinkels, cookies etc.
                <br>
                The choclaty goodness alone is enough to make naybody want a second bite, the only reason its placed so low is a brownie always needs something a littl extra to compete, which puts it in my 3rd slot.
                <br>
                If you want to have a taste bud parade, try a brownie with something a little extra today!
